# Import System

https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html

> All packages are modules, but not all modules are packages

> Packages are just a special kind of module

> Any module that contains a `__path__` attribute is considered a package

> A regular package is typically implemented as a directory containing an `__init__.py` file.
